Datatype         . Description
----------------------------------------------------------
NUMBER(p,s)      . Stores zero, positive, and negative
                 . numbers with up to 38 digits precision.
                 . `p`: precision (total digits)
                 . `s`: scale (digits after decimal point)

INTEGER          . Subtype of NUMBER, equivalent to
                 . `NUMBER(p, 0)`; stores whole numbers.

FLOAT(p)         . Subtype of NUMBER for floating-point
                 . numbers; `p` specifies binary precision.

BINARY_FLOAT     . 32-bit floating-point number. Optimized
                 . for fast arithmetic calculations.

BINARY_DOUBLE    . 64-bit floating-point number. Optimized
                 . for performance during operations.
2. Character Datatypes

Datatype         . Description
----------------------------------------------------------
CHAR(n)          . Fixed-length character string. If data
                 . is shorter than n, Oracle pads it with
                 . spaces. Maximum size is 2000 bytes.

VARCHAR2(n)      . Variable-length character string. It
                 . stores data with exactly as many bytes
                 . as needed. Maximum size is 4000 bytes.

NCHAR(n)         . Fixed-length character string supporting
                 . Unicode. Useful for multibyte character
                 . sets (e.g., Asian languages).

NVARCHAR2(n)     . Variable-length Unicode character string.
                 . Maximum size: 4000 bytes.

CLOB             . Character Large Object. Stores large
                 . text data, up to 4 GB.
3. Date and Time Datatypes

Datatype         . Description
----------------------------------------------------------
DATE             . Stores date and time information
                 . (year, month, day, hour, minute,
                 . second). Range: January 1, 4712 BC,
                 . to December 31, 9999 AD.

TIMESTAMP        . Stores both date and time, with optional
                 . fractional seconds. Format:
                 . `TIMESTAMP [(fractional_seconds_precision)]`

TIMESTAMP WITH   . Includes time zone information, in addition
TIME ZONE        . to date and time data. Useful for applications
                 . with multiple geographical locations.

TIMESTAMP WITH   . Stores timestamp data with local time
LOCAL TIME ZONE  . zone adjustments, meaning the data is
                 . converted to the sessionâ€™s time zone.

INTERVAL YEAR    . Stores a period of time in years and months.
TO MONTH         . Useful for calculating time differences.

INTERVAL DAY     . Stores a period of time in days, hours,
TO SECOND        . minutes, and seconds. Also for time calculations.
4. LOB (Large Object) Datatypes

Datatype         . Description
----------------------------------------------------------
BLOB             . Binary Large Object. Stores large binary
                 . data, such as images or multimedia files.
                 . Can store up to 4 GB.

CLOB             . Character Large Object. For storing large
                 . text data. Can store up to 4 GB of
                 . character data.

NCLOB            . National Character Large Object. Same as
                 . CLOB, but specifically for multibyte
                 . character sets (Unicode).

BFILE            . Points to large binary files stored outside
                 . the database, typically on the server's file
                 . system. BFILEs are read-only.
5. Raw and RowID Datatypes

Datatype         . Description
----------------------------------------------------------
RAW(n)           . Stores variable-length binary data.
                 . Maximum size is 2000 bytes.

LONG RAW         . Stores variable-length binary data.
                 . Deprecated for most uses, as BLOB
                 . should be used instead.

ROWID            . Stores unique row addresses in the
                 . database. Used internally by Oracle to
                 . locate rows.

UROWID           . Universal ROWID. Extends the ROWID to
                 . allow for indexing non-Oracle
                 . databases or clustered databases.


6.Empty field

NULL               : null is used to showcase where data is absent in field
                     its not equal to 0 or ""
                     in count the null is not counted
