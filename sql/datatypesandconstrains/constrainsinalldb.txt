1. Constraints in Oracle

Constraint       . Description
----------------------------------------------------------
PRIMARY KEY      . Ensures the column(s) contain unique
                 . values and do not allow `NULL`. Defines
                 . the unique identifier for a row in a table.

UNIQUE           . Ensures all values in the column are unique.
                 . Multiple `UNIQUE` constraints can exist on
                 . a table, unlike the `PRIMARY KEY`.

NOT NULL         . Ensures the column does not allow `NULL`
                 . values. Every row must contain a value
                 . in this column.

FOREIGN KEY      . Ensures values in a column or group
                 . of columns match values in another tableâ€™s
                 . `PRIMARY KEY` or `UNIQUE` column.

CHECK            . Ensures the values in a column satisfy a
                 . specific condition or logical expression.

DEFAULT          . Assigns a default value to a column if no
                 . value is provided when inserting data.

ENABLE/DISABLE   . Enables or disables a constraint without
                 . deleting it. Useful for temporarily turning
                 . off validation.
2. Constraints in Hive
(Note: Hive has limited support for constraints, especially compared to traditional RDBMS like Oracle and PostgreSQL. Constraints such as PRIMARY KEY or FOREIGN KEY are not enforced in Hive, though they can be declared.)

Constraint       . Description
----------------------------------------------------------
PRIMARY KEY      . Can be declared but is not enforced
                 . in Hive. Used mainly for documentation
                 . or tools outside Hive.

FOREIGN KEY      . Similar to `PRIMARY KEY`, it can be
                 . declared but is not enforced.
                 . Relational integrity is not guaranteed.

NOT NULL         . Ensures the column does not allow
                 . `NULL` values. Starting from Hive 0.13.0,
                 . the `NOT NULL` constraint is enforced.

CHECK            . Declared but not enforced. This is more
                 . for documentation and external validation.

DEFAULT          . Starting in Hive 2.3.0, columns can have
                 . a default value, which is used when an
                 . `INSERT` operation omits the column.
3. Constraints in PostgreSQL

Copy code
Constraint       . Description
----------------------------------------------------------
PRIMARY KEY      . Ensures each row in the table has a
                 . unique identifier. No `NULL` values are
                 . allowed. Typically used for indexing.

UNIQUE           . Ensures all values in a column or
                 . group of columns are unique across rows.

NOT NULL         . Ensures a column cannot store `NULL`
                 . values. It forces a value to be present
                 . for every record.

FOREIGN KEY      . Establishes a relationship between
                 . columns in two tables, ensuring data
                 . integrity across them.

CHECK            . Ensures that a column satisfies a
                 . specific condition, such as `CHECK (age > 18)`.

DEFAULT          . Sets a default value for a column.
                 . The default is used when no value is
                 . explicitly inserted.

EXCLUDE          . Specifies an exclusion constraint, which
                 . ensures that if any two rows are compared
                 . on the specified column(s), they do not
                 . violate the exclusion condition. Used
                 . mainly for custom uniqueness constraints.

DEFERRABLE       . Specifies when a constraint is enforced.
                 . It can be `IMMEDIATE` (default) or `DEFERRED`
                 . (checked at the end of a transaction).
